This app uses the feature of <i><b>async</b></i>, this makes the app continue to perform the following task in the background while the rest of the app is being continuously built, this does not stop the rest of the app from pausing its execution.

This application uses the permission feature and takes permission from user for accessing their device's location, also this contains the initState() function using which we can load a function as soon as the application loads into the device.
